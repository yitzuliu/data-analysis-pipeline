# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Workflow for Airbnb Cleaned Dataset

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 1: SETUP AND DATA LOADING
# =============================================================================

# 1.1 Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Set visualization style for consistency
plt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-whitegrid')  # Modern, clean style
sns.set_palette("deep")  # Color palette suitable for business presentations

# 1.2 Load the cleaned Airbnb dataset
try:
    df = pd.read_csv('Datasource/airbnb_clean.csv')
    print('✅ Airbnb cleaned dataset loaded successfully.')
except Exception as e:
    print(f'❌ Error loading dataset: {e}')
    df = None

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 2: DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT
# =============================================================================

# 2.1 Preview the dataset
if df is not None:
    print("\n=== DATA PREVIEW ===")
    print(df.head())           # Show the first 5 rows
    print("\n=== DATA INFORMATION ===")
    print(df.info())           # Show data types and non-null counts
    print("\n=== SUMMARY STATISTICS ===")
    print(df.describe())       # Show summary statistics
else:
    print('No data loaded to preview.')

# 2.2 Check for missing values and data types
if df is not None:
    print('\n=== DATA QUALITY CHECK ===')
    print('Missing values per column:')
    print(df.isnull().sum())
    
    # Calculate percentage of missing values
    print('\nMissing values percentage:')
    print(round(100 * df.isnull().sum() / len(df), 2))
    
    print('\nData types:')
    print(df.dtypes)
    
    # Check for duplicates
    print(f'\nNumber of duplicate rows: {df.duplicated().sum()}')
else:
    print('No data loaded to check for missing values or data types.')

# SECTION 3: BUSINESS QUESTIONS & ANALYSIS GOALS
# =============================================================================

# Define the key business questions we want to answer through this analysis:
# 1. What factors most significantly influence property prices?
# 2. Which neighborhoods offer the best value for different types of properties?
# 3. How do ratings correlate with price, location, and property characteristics?
# 4. What insights can help hosts optimize their pricing strategy?
# 5. What patterns exist in guest preferences (as reflected by review counts)?
# 6. What recommendations can we provide to new hosts entering the market?
