## 🏆 Project Results

### Dataset Evaluation Results
Our systematic framework evaluated 6 datasets and selected the optimal one based on:

| Rank | Dataset | Final Score | Key Strengths |
|------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 🥇 1 | **Selected Dataset** | **XX.X/100** | High business relevance, excellent data quality |
| 🥈 2 | Alternative | XX.X/100 | Strong technical potential |
| 🥉 3 | Option 3 | XX.X/100 | Good balance of factors |

*Note: Scores will be updated after running the evaluation notebook*
