## üìä Evaluation Criteria Framework

### **1. Data Quality Assessment**

#### Missing Data Percentage
- **Excellent (90-100% complete)**: Minimal missing data, ready for analysis
- **Good (80-89% complete)**: Some missing data, manageable with cleaning
- **Fair (70-79% complete)**: Significant missing data, requires advanced imputation
- **Poor (<70% complete)**: Too much missing data, may compromise analysis quality

#### General Cleanliness
- **Data Type Consistency**: Are columns properly typed (numbers as numeric, dates as datetime)?
- **Obvious Errors**: Impossible values, formatting issues, duplicate records
- **Data Structure**: Well-organized columns, logical naming conventions

#### Dataset Size
- **Large (50K+ rows)**: Demonstrates scalability and big data handling
- **Medium (10K-50K rows)**: Good balance of complexity and manageability  
- **Small (1K-10K rows)**: Sufficient for analysis but limited scalability showcase
- **Very Small (<1K rows)**: Limited analytical opportunities

### **2. Business Relevance Evaluation**

#### Real-world Applicability

- **Medium**: Middle management interest, operational improvements
- **Low**: Technical team interest only

### **3. Technical Complexity & Skill Showcase**

#### Statistical Analysis Opportunities
- **Rich**: Multiple variables for correlation, segmentation, trend analysis
- **Moderate**: Some statistical analysis possible
- **Limited**: Basic descriptive statistics only

#### Visualization Potential
- **Excellent**: Geographic, time-series, multi-dimensional visualization opportunities
- **Good**: Standard charts and graphs with some complexity
- **Basic**: Simple charts only

#### ML/AI Applications
- **High**: Clear predictive modeling, clustering, classification opportunities
- **Medium**: Some ML applications possible

## üìã Dataset Assessment Process

### **Step 1: Quick Data Loading & Inspection**
For each dataset, we will:
1. Load the data using pandas
2. Check basic information: `df.info()`, `df.shape`
3. Calculate missing data percentage: `df.isnull().sum()`
4. Display column names and sample data: `df.head()`, `df.columns.tolist()`

### **Step 2: Business Relevance Review**
1. **Print all column names** for manual business relevance assessment
2. Identify potential business questions the data could answer
3. Assess revenue/cost analysis opportunities
4. Evaluate executive interest level

### **Step 3: Technical Complexity Evaluation**
1. Assess data types and complexity
2. Identify statistical analysis opportunities
3. Evaluate visualization potential
4. Consider ML/AI application possibilities

### **Step 4: Scoring & Ranking**
Create a systematic scoring matrix to objectively compare datasets.
